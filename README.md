# Distant Signal

**Distant Signal** is a CircuitPython script for an ESP32 to displays the state of a remote
model-railroad turnout on a LED Matrix Display.
A small custom language allows one to define the panel display, and then animate it with a simple trigger.
The color and animation script can be loaded from an MQTT broker.



## Hardware used for this project

- [AdaFruit MatrixPortal CircuitPython ESP32-S3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5778)
- [AdaFruit 64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 4mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2278)
  or equivalent.

The script is fairly customizable. There are many more LED Matrix displays compatible
with the [AdaFruit MatrixPortal](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3)
platform that should work.


### ESP32 Setup

Instructions for the [MatrixPortal ESP32-S3](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3).
This page has the
[specification, pin out](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3/pinouts)
and this page
[explains how to connect the LED Matrix display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3/prep-the-matrixportal).

- I power the Matrix Portal S3 with a 5V 4A USB-C power supply, as recommended.
  However that seems a tad overkill as I have measured the power supply to deliver
  only between 1A and 2A. It probably depends on how busy the screen is, the current
  application fills maybe 1/3rd of the pixels or even less.

- The device should already come with a USB bootloader and create a USB drive visible
  under Windows or Linux.
  If needed follow the
  [instructions to reflash the bootloader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3/factory-reset#factory-reset-and-bootloader-repair-3107941).

- Plug the ESP32, click the reset button, and as the onboard LED becomes purple,
  immediately click the reset button again. If you do it right, the onboard LED should
  stay and remain _green_. A drive named `QTPYS2BOOT` should appear on USB.

- Run the `setup/_get_circuitpy_uf2.sh` script and drop the downloaded `uf2` file on the
  USB drive. Once the device reboot, a USB drive named `CIRCUITPY` should appear.

- Uploading the code on the ESP32 is done by _copying_ files to the USB drive named
 `CIRCUITPY`.
  You can drag'n'drop stuff manually. I prefer to automate things using scripts with MSYS,
  Cygwin, or Git Bash.

- Tip: Open `src/_lib_upload.sh` and `src/_upload.sh`.

  Change the line `D="/d /f /cygdrive/f"` at the beginning to add the drive letter needed
  for your USB drive. For example "F:" is "/f" under MSYS, "/cygdrive/f" under Cygwin,
  or "/media/usb" under Linux.

I run these from the Terminal tab in VS Code:

```
cd src
# upload all libraries (once)
./_lib_upload.sh adafruit_logging
./_lib_upload.sh adafruit_connection_manager
./_lib_upload.sh adafruit_ticks
./_lib_upload.sh adafruit_minimqtt
./_lib_upload.sh neopixel
./_lib_upload.sh adafruit_matrixportal
./_lib_upload.sh adafruit_bitmap_font
./_lib_upload.sh adafruit_display_text

# upload source code (after each modification)
./_upload.sh
```

Update settings:

- Open `setup\settings.toml`.
- Open `F:\settings.toml` (or whatever is your CIRCUITPY USB Drive)
- Copy the settings to the USB drive file, and modify as needed to set the SSID/password
  for your wifi and your MQTT server information:

```
# Setting these variables will automatically connect board to WiFi on boot
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID="Your WiFi SSID Here"
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD="Your WiFi Password Here"

# MQTT integration.
MQTT_BROKER_IP=""
MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883
MQTT_USERNAME="username"
MQTT_PASSWORD="password"
MQTT_TOPIC_ROOT="ambiance"

# Default NeoPixel strip length
NEO_LEN="100"
# NEO_STRIP_PIN can be "A1" or "ONBOARD" (onboard LED)
NEO_STRIP_PIN="A1"
```

### Development and Debugging

To monitor the serial out of the
[AdaFruit QT PY ESP32-S2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5325),
configure VS Code Serial Monitor with Text mode, Port USB, Baud rate 115200, Line ending LF.

Note that whilst the ESP32 resets (after pressing the "reset" button),
VS Code disconnects from the USB port and loses valuable debug information.
Thus you can't debug your script if it fails to load this way.
Instead, the easiest way to debug a broken script is to _upload_ it.
Any upload triggers a soft reboot which reloads the Python VM and exposes any  missing imports:

```
cd src
./_upload.sh
```



## MQTT Interaction

**Ambiance** is used by the 
[Randall Train Automation Controller](https://www.alfray.com/trains/randall/rtac.html)
software via MQTT.
The automation controller publishes "color scripts" via MQTT topics, which are then
fetched and executed by the ESP32.

When used with the train automation controller, two colors scripts are used:

- An initial color pattern is executed when the train layout powers up.
  Once executed, the color pattern is static and does not change.
- A short color animation happens when a train starts its automatic run.
  This is done by defining an "event script" and a separate "event trigger".

The following MQTT topics are used:

- `ambiance/length`: The number of LEDs to fill and animate. This is currently set to a 100
  based on the fairy string currently used. Changing this topic on the MQTT broker allows to
  easily reconfigure the ESP32 program without having to upload a new sketch.

- `ambiance/brightness`: A float in the range 0..1. 0 corresponds to all LEDs off, and 1
  corresponds to maximum brightness.

- `ambiance/script/init`: The color script executed when the ESP32 starts.
  This script is executed as soon as it changes. 
  If the same script is sent twice in a row, it is executed only once.

- `ambiance/script/event`: The script executed for animation events.
  This script does not execute immediately.
  It only executes when the `event/trigger` topic is set.

- `ambiance/event/trigger`: The trigger for the event script.
  Any value different than the last one provided triggers the execution of the event script.




## LED Color Light Sequencer


An addressable LED string acts as a linear buffer of RGB values: a maximum number of
"pixels" can be controlled, each with an individual RGB color.

The number of LEDs in the string is configued by `NEO_LEN` in `code.py` and can be
overwritten using the `Lenght` instruction in the script (see below).

Often Arduino or ESP32 projects simply hardcode LED RGB values in their program, and
one needs to recompile and upload a new program to change the color pattern.

The main goal of **Ambiance** is to make it easy to change that color pattern:
the **Sequencer** reads a simple text-based scripting language that defines the color
patterns to use to fill the LED string, and how to animate it.

### Script syntax

- All instructions are separated by a semi-colon.
- An instruction beginning with # is a comment and ignored (till EOL or ;)
- Instructions are case-insensitive.
- RGB colors must be in the pattern #RRGGBB or RRGGBB. The # is optional.

### Control Instructions

`Length int ;`

This instuctions sets the number of the specified integer. Must be > 0 and < the maximum
buffer size compiled in the program (`NEO_LEN` in `code.py`, which defaults to 100).

`Brightness float ;`

This instruction sets the LED brightness, between 0 (off) and 1 (full brightness).
Note that the luminosity granularity depends on the LEDs being used. Default is 1.

`Trigger ;`

This instruction takes not parameter and is not recorded. 
When used, it triggers an execution of the currently defined event script in the main loop.
This is useful at the end of an event to force the event to trigger once immediately.


## Color Filling Instructions

`Fill RGB1 Count1 [RGB2 Count2 ... RGBn Countn]`

This instruction fills the LED buffer _instantly_  with a _repeated_ pattern of
the color list given.

The count number does not need to match the length of the LED string (as defined
by the `Length` instruction): the pattern automatically repeats as many times as needed
to fill the LED buffer.

`SlowFill Delay RGB1 Count1 [RGB2 Count2 ... RGBn Countn]`

This is the same as the `Fill` instruction except the buffer is filled slowly with
a "delay" pause between each LED. The delay is a float representing seconds.


# Color Aninmation Instructions

`Slide Delay Count`

This instruction "slides" all the LED colors in the buffer by the `count` number,
with a pause in between each LED shifting. Essentially the delay controls the speed of the effect. The delay is a float representing seconds.

A delay value of zero is invalid.

When the delay is positive, the colors shift from the beginning towards the end of
the LED string.
If the delay is negative, it reverses the direction of the slide/shift effect;
the colors shift from the end towards the beginning of the LED string.


### Example Effects

Xmas colors:
```
"Fill #000000 1 ; SlowFill 0.1 #00FF00 10 #FF0000 10 ; Slide 0.1 80 "
```

* `Fill #000000 1` quick "erases" all colors and thus turns off all LEDs in the string.
* `SlowFill` then progressively make the colors re-appear, one by one.
  There is a repeated pattern of 10 green LEDs followed by 10 red LEDs.
  On a 100-LED string, the pattern is thus repeated 4 times.
* `Slide 0.1 80` shifts the colors 80 times. Since this is a multiple of the fill pattern
  length (10 green + 10 red = 20 LEDs), this gives the impressive that the green/red
  colors move 4 times and then end up in the same position.
  With a delay of 0.1 seconds and 80 iterations, the animation lasts 8 seconds.


Halloween colors:
```
"Fill #000000 1 ; SlowFill 0.1 #FF1000 40 #FF4000 10 ; Slide 0.1 100"
```

* `Fill #000000 1` quick "erases" all colors and thus turns off all LEDs in the string.
* `SlowFill` then progressively make the colors re-appear, one by one.
  There is a repeated pattern of 40 orange LEDs followed by 10 yellow LEDs.
  On a 100-LED string, the pattern is thus repeated twice.
* `Slide 0.05 100` shifts the colors 100 times. Since this is the size of the LED string
  pattern, the animation ends in the same state that it started.
  With a delay of 0.05 seconds and 100 iterations, the animation lasts 5 seconds.


### Usage As a Library

The **Sequencer** can be used as a standalone library:

```
neo = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.A1, NEO_LEN, auto_write = False, pixel_order=(0, 1, 2))
seq = sequencer.Sequencer(sequencer.NeoWrapper(neo, NEO_LEN))
seq.parse(""" Fill #000000 1 ; 
              SlowFill 0.1  #00FF00 10  #FF0000 10 ;
              Slide 0.1 80 """)
while seq.step(): True
```
